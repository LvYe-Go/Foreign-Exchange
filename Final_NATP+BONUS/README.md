The readme is about NATP and improment on the transformer on features.

1. NATP 

(1) Addding narrative text on the comment place, you can see it when open with edit mode in PPT. 

(2) For it is for the non audience, when take example for decision tree, I do not use the case on the project first but use a whether forecast example to introduce deciosn tree concept to audience.

(3) In addition to the ppt template, also adding a slide to explain what I learned and experienced in these projects.


2. Bonus  (will upload in one minute)
